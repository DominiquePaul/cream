I have figured out the inference part in a simple script. Now Im wondering how I can set up the streaming in terms of infrastructure. 

I need something that is compatible with an upload from (a) a nextjs web app but also (b) a python script running locally. Somehow I need to then process them with an ML model and then another part of the nextjs app needs to be able to read them. 



- I have a nextjs app that allows users to start a livestream. 
- Right now it sends the webcam frames to a websocket server (code of the socker server shown). 
- I would like to process frames with a ML model (img2img diffusion model) and then send the back to websocket server so stream viewers see these frames instead of the original ones. 
- One constraint is that the ML model will be a bit slow. It takes 5 seconds to process a single frame. 

How can I best set this up to ensure: 
- that the lag doesnt increase over time? I don't want to process all frames, but only the most recent one after the GPU has finished processing the previous one. (I'm kind of flexible on this requirement)



I now want to add a registration/login system to the webapp.

Features:
- Users need to register to start a stream
- A user can needs to consume credits to start a stream
- A user can buy more credits using stripe checkout.
- A user can only have one stream active at a time.
- A user stream url is tied to their username.
- A user can only start a stream if they have enough credits.
- A user can only start a stream if they are logged in.
- Viewers do not need to be logged in. 
- Users can add comments to streams
- If a streamer has enabled this stream feature, users can request styles for the stream that are applied to the diffusion model. 
- A streamer can enable/disable comments and styles. 
- A streamer can only start a stream if they have more than 1 credit.
- 1 credit allows streaming for 10 minutes.
- A streamer can see how many people are watching their stream.

Implementation Approach
I suggest we tackle these workpages in the following order:
- Authentication System (foundational requirement)
- Credits System (required for stream management)
- Stream Management (core functionality)
- Payment Integration (enhances credits system)
- Viewer Experience (public-facing features)
Streamer Controls (enhances user experience)
ML Model Integration (advanced functionality)
